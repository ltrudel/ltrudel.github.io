        <p>
        My name is Lance Trudel and I'm from Winnipeg, Manitoba. My main interests are creating things with computers, mostly programming and making games. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I took computer science for three years in high school along with digital media design for two years and graphic arts for four years. As a result i have modest experience with programming in C# and Java, creating videos in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, vector artwork with Illustrator, image manipulation with Photoshop and page layout with Indesign. I also have basic understanding of Adobe Animate, and Unity 3D, where I was developing some VR tests and Autodesk 3DS Max.
